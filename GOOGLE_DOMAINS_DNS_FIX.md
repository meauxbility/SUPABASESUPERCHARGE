# 🔧 Google Domains DNS Fix - Correct Approach

## 🎯 **You're in the RIGHT place!** 

The message you're seeing is **exactly what we want**. Google Domains is telling you that you need to change the A record, which is correct.

## 📋 **What to Do:**

### **Option 1: Use Google Domains Redirect (Easier)**
1. **Keep the current setting** you're seeing
2. **Change the redirect URL** from `http://meauxbility.org` to `https://supabasesupercharge.onrender.com`
3. **Save the changes**

### **Option 2: Manual DNS Changes (More Control)**
1. **Go back to the main DNS page**
2. **Look for "Custom resource records"** or "DNS records" section
3. **Find the A record** with `@` and `23.227.38.71`
4. **Edit it** to point to `44.229.227.142`

## 🔍 **Finding the Right Section:**

### **Look for these sections in Google Domains:**
- **"DNS"** tab
- **"Custom resource records"**
- **"Name servers"** (don't change this)
- **"Synthetic records"** (this might be what you're seeing)

### **What You Should See:**
```
Type: A
Name: @
Data: 23.227.38.71
```

## 🎯 **Recommended Approach:**

### **Step 1: Try the Redirect Method First**
1. **Change the redirect URL** to `https://supabasesupercharge.onrender.com`
2. **Save changes**
3. **Test in 5-15 minutes**

### **Step 2: If Redirect Doesn't Work**
1. **Go to "Custom resource records"** section
2. **Find the A record** for `@`
3. **Change the IP** from `23.227.38.71` to `44.229.227.142`

## 🧪 **Test After Changes:**
- **Visit:** `meauxbility.org`
- **Should show:** Your new Next.js app
- **Test page:** `meauxbility.org/test`

## ⚠️ **Important Notes:**
- **Don't change name servers** (keep Google's)
- **Don't change MX records** (Gmail will still work)
- **The redirect method is often easier** than manual DNS

## 🔄 **If Something Goes Wrong:**
- **Revert the redirect** back to the original URL
- **Or change A record back** to `23.227.38.71`
- **Wait 5-15 minutes** for changes to take effect

**Try the redirect method first - it's usually the easiest way!** 🚀
